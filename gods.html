        <h2>Kratos: The God of War</h2>
        <p>Kratos, the iconic protagonist of the God of War series, is a character of profound complexity and brutal strength. 
            Originating from Greek mythology as a Spartan warrior, his narrative arc transitions from vengeance against the gods of 
            Olympus to a journey of redemption and fatherhood in the Norse realms. Known for his signature ash-white skin—marked 
            by the ashes of his deceased family—and the Blades of Chaos, Kratos embodies rage, sorrow, and a quest for freedom 
            against the machinations of gods and fate. Over the series, he evolves from a figure consumed by anger and revenge to a
            more nuanced character seeking to escape his past and protect his son, Atreus, highlighting themes of growth, fatherhood, 
            and the cycle of violence. Kratos' journey is not just a tale of battles and gods but also a deeply personal story of a man 
            fighting against his demons, both literal and metaphorical, making him one of the most enduring and compelling characters in 
            video game history.
